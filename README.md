# Weather App
To use this weather app, simply pick a city of your choice, type it in the search bar and you will get the weather details!
I sourced the images from google.
I chose to use JavaScript to get the information because it is the most simple and effective way to get information to the front end, especially since I designed this using HTML and CSS.
